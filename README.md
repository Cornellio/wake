# wake

Wake is a minimal web view of life stream data stored in [been](https://github.com/chromakode/been). Wake is very bare-bones, intended as a vanilla scaffold to build upon, rather than a finished website.

For markdown files indexed and stored by been, wake provides a single-post page for each file accessible via a "slug" URL specified in the markdown or the filename. Wake also provides a simple [Atom feed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)) of *events* from been *sources* which are configured with the `syndicate` flag set to true.

The name "wake" is an analogy to the trail of activity we leave across the web. Wake is the visible manifestation of that passing.
